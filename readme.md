## Comparative Charts Project" 🚀

This is a kickass web app that compares player stats using super sleek bar charts.
The app includes smooth animations when loading the bars and buttons that let you switch between different time ranges (7 days, 30 days, 90 days, 180 days). 
It's built using React.js, Vite.js, and Styled Components, so you know it's top quality. Go ahead and give it a try!
